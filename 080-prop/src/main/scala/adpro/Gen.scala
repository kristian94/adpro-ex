// You should work with the file by following the associated exercise sheet

//
// The file shall always compile and run after you are done with each exercise
// (if you do them in order).  Please compile and test frequently. Of course,
// some tests will be failing until you finish. Only hand in a solution that
// compiles and where tests pass for all parts that you finished.    The tests
// will fail for unfnished parts.  Comment such out.
//
// Before starting to work on the exercises, familiarize yourself with the the
// content already in the file (it has been explained in chapter 8, but it is
// useful to see it all together in one file).
