  //Exercise 09
  //Put your answer here:
  /*
    For a List, the implementation would cause every element of the List to be evaulauted by the call to 'filter'. But since
    streams are lazy, we only evaluate elements until we find an 'x' where p(x) is true, instead of computing p(x) for all elements
    (as we would do with the List implementation).
